# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Anaconda, Jupyter
## Overview
The project was requested by the school district to analyze specific metrics using the school and student data.  The analysis needed to factor in cleaning of the names (removing prefixes and suffixes) and removing grades where they have been marked as suspicions and replacing them with NaN. The analysis needed to report on the metrics such as total district review, a summary by school, average scores by grade and school, and looking at scores based on school size, school spend and school type.  


The purpose of this project was to use python & pandas to update the reading and writing scores of the grade nines at Thomson High School and then to recalculate the analysis with the updated grades. 
## Results

    •Average math score decreased by 0.1% from 79.0 to 78.9

    •Number of students who passed math decreased by 0.2%, from 75.0% to 74.8%

    •No change to average reading score - it remained 81.9

    •Number of students who passed reading decreased by 0.1% from 85.8% to 85.7%

    •Overall passing decreased by 0.3%, from 65.2 to 64.9%
